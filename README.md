# KMGCCL
The method leverages multi-level graph coarsening to obtain both global and local structural information of the graph, employs super-cluster contrastive learning to extract more expressive node features, and enhances the separability of the embedding space. By integrating multi-scale graph coarsening and contrastive learning strategies.
